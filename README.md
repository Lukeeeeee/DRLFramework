# A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework based on DDPG and Fuzzy Logic Rule.

Step1: Using Fuzzy Logic Rule to pre-train the neural network in DDPG.
Step2: Update itself by reinforcement learning.

This framework can be extended to any different environments and deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
